ðŸ§ª Sample 1:
"Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

ðŸ¤” Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
The user describes multiple hardware issues: sensor interruptions and dongle malfunction.

Mentions attempts to troubleshoot (wired vs wireless).

References the high price ($150) in frustration.
âœ… Relevant: Yes â€” clearly relates to performance and hardware reliability.

ðŸ§ª Sample 2:
"Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

ðŸ¤” Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
User believes product works flawlessly (positive), but price doesn't justify it (negative).

Suggests other cheaper alternatives offer similar performance.
