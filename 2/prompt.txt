Please help me convert the following informal bug report into a well-structured bug ticket. The ticket should include the following sections:

Title – A brief summary of the issue.

Description – A clear explanation of the problem, including what is happening and any relevant details.

Steps to Reproduce – A list of steps that can be followed to reproduce the bug.

Expected vs Actual Behavior – What the expected behavior is vs what is actually happening.

Environment (if known) – Information on the environment (e.g., browser version, OS, device type, etc.).

Severity or Impact – The impact level of the issue (e.g., critical, high, medium, low) and how it affects users.

Bug report to convert:
“Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”
