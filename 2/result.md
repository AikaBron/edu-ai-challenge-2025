Certainly! Hereâ€™s how I would structure that bug report:

Title:
Logout Button Non-Responsive on Safari Browser

Description:
The logout button does not function as expected on Safari. When clicked, there is no response, and the user is not logged out of the application. This issue is specific to Safari, and the button works as intended in other browsers.

Steps to Reproduce:
Open the application on Safari browser.

Log in with a valid user account.

Locate and click on the "Logout" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

Observe that no action is taken, and the user remains logged in.

Expected vs Actual Behavior:
Expected Behavior:
Clicking the "Logout" button should log the user out of the application and redirect them to the login page or display a confirmation message.

Actual Behavior:
The "Logout" button does not respond to clicks, and the user remains logged in.

Environment:
Browser: Safari (version X.X, if known)

Operating System: macOS (version X.X, if known)
