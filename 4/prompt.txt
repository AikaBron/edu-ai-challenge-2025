You are provided with the following JavaScript code snippet:

javascript
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
Please analyze the code sequentially from the perspectives of the following expert roles:

üë®‚Äçüíª 1. Experienced Developer
Focus on code quality, readability, and maintainability.

Identify redundant constructs, use of outdated syntax, naming issues, or structural improvements.

Provide specific suggestions to modernize or refactor the code.

üîê 2. Security Engineer
Focus on data validation, type safety, exposure risks, and potential vulnerabilities.

Review how input is handled, especially concerning trust boundaries.

Provide concrete improvements to harden the function against typical JavaScript/TypeScript risks.

üöÄ 3. Performance Specialist
Focus on loop efficiency, memory usage, and potential bottlenecks.

Consider implications of input size and runtime behavior.

Offer tangible optimizations that would improve performance at scale.

For each role, return a distinct section of feedback, including:

A brief summary of overall assessment

A list of specific, actionable recommendations

Optional: improved code snippets where relevant

The final result should be structured with clear headers for each expert persona.
