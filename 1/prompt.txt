You are tasked with selecting the most suitable database for a social platform with the following requirements:

1. Social platform with millions of users.
2. Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users.
3. High data read speed required.
4. Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations.
5. Scalability is important as the user base grows.

Please apply Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to carefully analyze these requirements and justify your selection of the most appropriate database type. 
Your reasoning should be step-by-step, clearly showing the thought process and how the final decision is made based on the requirements.

Take the following steps in your reasoning:

1. Identify the core requirements (e.g., read-heavy workload, scalability, data structure needs, etc.).
2. Consider the most common database types (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, Graph DB, etc.).
3. Analyze the pros and cons of each database type relative to the given requirements.
4. Evaluate which database types excel in high-read environments, scalability, and relationships between users (e.g., connections).
5. Conclude with a final recommendation based on the requirements and justify your choice.

Be thorough, clear, and structured in your analysis.
